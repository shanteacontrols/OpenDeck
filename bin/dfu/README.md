Firmware update on OpenDeck boards with firmware before version v5.0.0 is based on [LUFA HID bootloader](https://github.com/abcminiuser/lufa/tree/master/Bootloaders/HID). This directory contains compiled single-file executables of the [Python script](https://github.com/paradajz/OpenDeck/blob/master/src/bootloader/pc/hid_bootloader_loader.py) used to update the firmware on the MCU for Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.
